# Protecting PCBs: ESD-Safe Nylon Assembly Trays

Electrostatic discharge (ESD) ruins boards quietly—one mishandled carrier or plastic bin can zap devices below human perception. This guide shows how SLS-printed nylon (PA12) assembly trays, built with ESD-safe surfaces, improve PCB flow from SMT through hand-assembly and test while reducing scrap, rework, and handling time. We’ll cover materials, surface-resistance targets, design patterns that actually help technicians, and how to verify performance inside your ESD control program. ([The ANSI Blog][1], [IEC Webstore][2])

## Why ESD-Safe Nylon (PA12) Works for PCB Handling

### What “ESD-safe” actually means

In electronics manufacturing, materials are typically categorized by surface resistivity/r esistance:

* **Conductive:** ≤ 10⁴ Ω (or Ω/sq)
* **Static-dissipative:** > 10⁴ and < 10¹¹ Ω (or Ω/sq) — the sweet spot for carriers and tray surfaces in contact with boards
* **Insulative:** ≥ 10¹¹ Ω (or Ω/sq)

Keeping carriers in the **dissipative** range prevents fast, device-damaging discharges while avoiding charge buildup. Use ANSI/ESD STM11.11 when measuring planar materials to confirm you’re in range. ([UT Web][3], [ANSI 网店][4])

> **Standards context.** An ESD control program under ANSI/ESD S20.20 or IEC 61340-5-1 expects controlled materials, personnel grounding, and regular verification—your trays are part of that controlled system. ([The ANSI Blog][1], [IEC Webstore][2])

### Mechanical durability + chemical compatibility

SLS/MJF PA12 is tough, dimensionally stable, and handles common shop chemistries (oils, greases, aliphatic hydrocarbons, many alkalies, IPA exposure during cleaning) better than most printed plastics—ideal for reusable tooling. ([Cimquest Inc.][5], [Proto3000][6])

> **Not a reflow carrier.** PA12 melts around **178–180 °C**—below lead-free reflow peaks—so use it for handling and staging, not for solder ovens. ([校园塑料][7])

### Two ways to achieve an ESD-safe surface on PA12

1. **Inherently dissipative PA12** (filled or CNT-modified) — the bulk polymer sits in the dissipative/low-conductive range. Good for long-term stability. (Examples exist in the market for PA12-ESD and CNT-modified PA12 grades.) ([Filament2Print][8], [3DXTECH][9])
2. **Post-applied dissipative coating** — spray or dip a permanent ESD coating on printed PA12. This is fast to implement, field-serviceable, and easy to re-qualify. MG Chemicals **844AR** is a widely used ESD-safe acrylic for plastics (assembly trays are a standard use case). ([mgchemicals.com][10], [TestEquity][11])

## Design Patterns That Improve SMT & Hand-Assembly Flow

### 1) Component and board retention that doesn’t shed FOD

* **Printed flexures and spring-fingers in PA12** hold boards without metal clips or loose hardware.
* **Radiused lead-ins & finger scoops** make gloved handling easy.
* **Debris-resistant geometry:** closed profiles and internal fillets minimize chip traps. FOD control expectations (AS9146) favor tool designs that eliminate loose items and capture debris. ([SAE International][12])

### 2) Orientation & Poka-Yoke features

* **Asymmetric pockets, corner keys, and step-downs** prevent 180° or mirror loading.
* **Stencil-side/heat-sink-side guards** protect tall parts.
* **Built-in “no-touch” keep-out bosses** around optical windows and RF shields.

### 3) Labeling & traceability that survives the line

* **Recessed label wells** for 1D/2D codes or travelers; walls protect edges from abrasion.
* **Embossed artwork** (board PN, rev, process lane) can’t peel off; add a flat next to it for a barcode label.
* **Supports IPC-1782A traceability levels** by making data capture easy at each operation (clear label zones, consistent placement). ([electronics.org][13])

### 4) Stackability that saves space (and prevents ESD events)

* **Interlocking feet & rails** stabilize tall stacks on carts.
* **Nesting offsets** keep boards from touching when trays stack.
* **Lid options:** snap-on dust lids with dissipative surfaces for travel between EPAs. (ANSI/ESD S541 covers protective packaging principles—use dissipative materials for intimate contact). ([bystat.com][14])

### 5) Test-bench and conformal-coat staging

* **Probe windows & cable pass-throughs** built into the tray pocket reduce extra handling during verification.
* **Masking ledges** around keep-outs help spray operators position shields consistently.

## Surface-Resistance Targets and How to Verify

1. **Target range:** Design and qualify tray surfaces to the **static-dissipative** band (10⁶–10⁹ Ω typical; your spec may allow 10⁴–<10¹¹ Ω depending on policy). ([UT Web][3])
2. **Measure correctly:** Use **ANSI/ESD STM11.11** with the concentric-ring fixture on representative tray flats and inside pockets. Condition per the standard. ([ANSI 网店][4])
3. **Ongoing checks:** Fold your trays into your **TR53** compliance verification schedule (e.g., quarterly or per your plan). Record surface resistance and visual condition. ([ANSI 网店][15])
4. **Package wisely:** When moving between EPAs, use **dissipative** packaging layers per **ANSI/ESD S541** to avoid rapid discharges during transport. ([bystat.com][14])
5. **Program alignment:** Keep your tray spec sheet attached to the site **S20.20** or **IEC 61340-5-1** program documentation so auditors can tie fixtures to controls. ([The ANSI Blog][1], [IEC Webstore][2])

## Coated vs. Inherently Dissipative: Choosing the Right Path

| Option                                              | Upsides                                                               | Watch-outs                                                                 | Best for                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Inherently dissipative PA12 (filled/CNT grades)** | Conductivity throughout the part; durable; no re-coat                 | Color typically dark; lead time for qualified powder; slightly higher cost | High-volume reuse; harsh cleaning  |
| **ESD coating (e.g., 844AR)**                       | Fast to implement; field-reworkable; can retrofit existing PA12 trays | Requires prep & periodic verification; re-coat after heavy wear            | Pilots, job-shop builds, retrofits |

**Notes on 844AR:** It’s an acrylic, permanent ESD-safe coating formulated for plastics; common uses include **assembly trays** and workstation surfaces. Follow the TDS (roughen/clean, apply, cure) and then verify resistance with STM11.11 before release. ([mgchemicals.com][10], [TestEquity][11])

## Practical Geometry for PCB Trays (Patterns We Recommend)

* **Universal pocket with corner datum** for mixed panel sizes; add shim bridges for smaller boards.
* **Recessed traveler bay** sized for 2×4 in or 4×6 in labels; optional clear window if you use paper travelers.
* **Connector vaults & standoffs** so edge-connectors and test headers don’t take hits.
* **Mag-safe cart feet** (magnet-friendly pads) for stable transport—keeps stacks from sliding.
* **Alignment bosses** that engage pick-and-place carts or conveyor rails.
* **Drain slots** to prevent IPA pooling after wipe-downs.

## Cleanliness & FOD Control Built-In

Aerospace-style FOD expectations (AS9146) translate well to electronics: parts should avoid **loose hardware**, minimize debris traps, and be easy to inspect. With SLS PA12 you can print monolithic trays—no screws, no pads to fall off—add fillets, and keep transitions closed so nothing sheds into assemblies. Include FOD checks in your incoming and periodic inspections. ([SAE International][12])

## Qualification Checklist (Copy/Paste Into Your Traveler)

1. **Visual:** No burrs, powder residue, or loose particles (flashlight + wipe test).
2. **Dimensional:** Pocket datums ±0.3 mm unless otherwise noted (or per your print).
3. **ESD:** Surface resistance on representative flats and inside pockets; record per **STM11.11**. ([ANSI 网店][4])
4. **Verification frequency:** Add to **TR53** schedule (e.g., quarterly) with acceptance band noted. ([ANSI 网店][15])
5. **Label durability:** Peel test of barcode after 24 h; ensure scannability.
6. **Cleaning:** Wipe with IPA; confirm no swelling/softening; re-measure ESD after cleaning (PA12 is resistant to common shop solvents). ([Cimquest Inc.][5])

## Specifying Your Trays (What to Send Us)

* **PCB data:** STEP or board outline (DXF), panel size, tallest component, keep-out zones.
* **Process flow:** SMT only, or SMT + hand-assembly + test? Any conformal coat or wash steps?
* **ESD strategy:** Inherent ESD PA12 vs. coated PA12. Your required resistance band and audit method.
* **Stacking & transport:** Max stack height, cart shelf size, any interlock pattern you prefer.
* **Labeling:** Label size/format, fixed artwork (PN, rev, lane), and traceability level (IPC-1782A). ([electronics.org][13])

---

## Manufacturing & Lead Time

* **Process:** SLS or MJF PA12, bead-blasted, optionally coated with ESD 844AR if specified. ([mgchemicals.com][10])
* **Typical wall/pocket features:** 2.0–3.5 mm walls; ribs where long spans exist; 0.5–0.8 mm fillets to reduce stress risers.
* **Batching:** We can nest multiple tray variants in a single build to reduce cost and deliver quicker.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I put these trays through reflow?

No—PA12’s melt point is \~178–180 °C, below common lead-free reflow peaks; use them for handling and staging only. ([校园塑料][7])

### How do I prove trays are “ESD-safe” to an auditor?

Attach your surface-resistance test records (ANSI/ESD **STM11.11**) and your periodic verification plan (**TR53**) to the tray spec. Show how the trays fit into your **S20.20/IEC 61340-5-1** program (EPA boundaries, personnel grounding, packaging). ([ANSI 网店][4], [The ANSI Blog][1], [IEC Webstore][2])

### Coated vs. inherently dissipative—what’s more durable?

Inherently dissipative PA12 is generally the longest-lasting. Coatings like **844AR** are great for retrofits and can be re-applied during maintenance—verify performance after coating. ([mgchemicals.com][10])

### Will IPA or flux cleaners damage the trays?

PA12 has good resistance to many shop chemistries and IPA; always follow your chemical supplier’s guidance and re-verify ESD after cleaning. ([Cimquest Inc.][5])
