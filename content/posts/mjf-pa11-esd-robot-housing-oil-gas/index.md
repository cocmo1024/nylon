# Oil & Gas Pipeline Inspection Robots: MJF PA11-ESD Protective Housings and Treads

**TL;DR** — For pipeline inspection robots, PA11-based nylon printed on industrial powder-bed systems (e.g., MJF/LS) delivers a rare mix of **impact toughness, abrasion resistance, and chemical durability**. When static control is required around sensors and electronics, ESD-modified PA11 or ESD print modes keep charge in check, with practical **surface resistivity targets in the 10^5–10^9 Ω/sq range**. Always validate ESD after post-processing (dyeing, vapor smoothing), and re-test in your worst-case humidity/temperature.

## Why PA11 for Pipeline Robots

Pipeline crawlers and ILI (in-line inspection) robots operate in tight, contaminated spaces and are exposed to hydrocarbons, inhibitors, water, salts, and mechanical shock. **Polyamide 11 (PA11)** is well-known in oil & gas for:

* **High impact toughness** down to low temperatures.
* **Excellent abrasion resistance** vs. many engineering plastics.
* **Good hydrocarbon and saltwater resistance**, suitable for housings, covers, and tread carriers.
* **Lower moisture uptake** than PA6/66, helping dimensional stability.

Printing PA11 via **Multi Jet Fusion (MJF)** or **laser sintering** yields dense, isotropic parts with production-grade repeatability—ideal for field-replaceable shells, bumpers, cable guards, and tread modules.

## ESD Behavior: What “Good” Looks Like

If your robot packs sensitive electronics, lidar, or high-gain analog front-ends, define an ESD envelope for non-metallic enclosures:

* **Target surface resistivity:** **10^5–10^9 Ω/sq** (static-dissipative).
* **Measure consistently:** Use a concentric ring fixture and document RH/°C.
* **Design for a path to ground:** Provide metal touchpoints or braided jumpers tying panels to system ground.
* **Retest after finishing:** Vapor smoothing, dyeing, or clear coats can shift readings.

> **Tip:** Map measurements at multiple points—outer shell, inner bosses, and tread lug faces—to catch local variability.

## Chemical Exposure: Quick Compatibility Snapshot (Indicative)

Real fluids and temperatures vary. Use this table only as a **screening guide** and run your own soak tests at operating conditions.

| Medium / Contaminant            | 20 °C |   60 °C |   90 °C | Notes                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----: | ------: | ------: | --------------------------------------- |
| Diesel / kerosene / crude       |  Good |    Good |    Good | Minimal swelling; wipe-down recommended |
| Alkanes (propane–hexane)        |  Good |    Good |    Good | Check aromatics content in local fuels  |
| Sea water / brine               |  Good |    Good |    Good | Rinse to limit salt deposition          |
| Glycols & typical inhibitors    |  Good |    Good | Limited | Verify specific chemistry               |
| NaOH ≤10%                       |  Good | Limited |    Poor | Avoid hot caustic soak                  |
| HCl ≤10%                        |  Good | Limited |    Poor | Avoid elevated temp exposure            |
| Strong oxidizers (e.g., nitric) |  Poor |    Poor |    Poor | Not recommended                         |

**Legend:** Good = stable; Limited = noticeable swelling/staining; Poor = attack.

## Impact & Abrasion: Shells and Treads That Survive

* **Housings & bumpers:** PA11’s toughness helps survive weld-crown hits and debris impacts. Use generous fillets and ribbing to disperse stress.
* **Tread covers/blocks:** PA11 resists wear on rough steel and in slurry. For maximum traction on oily surfaces, pair a **PA11 carrier** with **TPU lugs**; bolt-on lug segments allow fast swaps without replacing the carrier.

---

## MJF PA11 vs. PA11-ESD vs. ESD Print Modes

* **MJF PA11 (standard):** Workhorse for most shells and carriers; add ESD control via design (grounding, shielding) or post-treatments if needed.
* **PA11-ESD powders (LS):** Built-in dissipative behavior across the part volume; useful when tight ESD budgets or powder-bed compatibility drive the choice.
* **ESD print modes (platform-specific):** Some MJF platforms support ESD behavior on specific materials (often PA12). Use when you must standardize on one printer family; confirm your ESD window on first-article builds.

---

## Post-Processing: Finishing Without Losing ESD

* **Bead-blast:** Easiest cosmetic; minimal effect on ESD in most cases.
* **Vapor smoothing:** Seals porosity, improves cleanability and liquid repellence—great for surfaces returning coated in condensate or fines. **Re-measure surface resistivity** afterward.
* **Dyeing / coatings:** Black dye improves UV uniformity; conductive paints/foils can be added in targeted EMI zones. Verify adhesion on smoothed substrates.

## Practical Design Rules (Field-Proven)

1. **Walls & ribs:** 2.0–3.0 mm outer skins; rib thickness 1.0–1.2× wall; fillet ≥0.75× wall.
2. **Fasteners:** Heat-set brass inserts in load paths; keep edge distance ≥1.5× insert OD.
3. **Sealing:** Use continuous compression stops for O-rings; re-check IP after humidity conditioning.
4. **Grounding:** Integrate spring fingers or bonded studs between panels; include test pads for continuity checks.
5. **Serviceability:** Slot-and-tab alignment with sacrificial “crash ribs” protects seal lands during reassembly.
6. **Traceability:** Laser-etch part IDs and ESD lot/date on an internal flat.

---

## Traction Systems: Geometry & Attachment

* **Patterns:**

  * *Chevron:* forward drive on scale and light sludge.
  * *Open-lug:* sheds fines; good for debris fields.
  * *Continuous ribs:* kinder to coated pipe IDs.

* **Attachment:** Countersunk fasteners with Nylock nuts or thread-forming screws into reinforced bosses. For bonded TPU, scuff → clean (IPA) → prime per adhesive vendor → press-cure.

* **Friction vs. finish:** Smoothing the **housing** is great; leaving **tread faces** slightly textured often preserves dry friction.

---

## Verification & QA Checklist

* **Surface resistivity (Ω/sq):** Target **10^5–10^9**. Record method, RH/°C, and test locations.
* **Volume resistivity (Ω·cm):** Plaque-level if required by your ESD budget.
* **Chemical soak:** 24–168 h in site fluids at temperature (diesel, inhibitor, brine, cleaning agents).
* **Mechanical:** Taber abrasion (specify wheel/load/cycles) and drop/impact to your acceptance thresholds.
* **Ingress:** IP gage after humidity conditioning and after each finishing step.
* **Dimensional:** Pre- and post-finish CMM on sealing and bearing interfaces.

## Compliance Notes for U.S. Deployments

* **ESD-safe plastics ≠ intrinsic safety.** Hazardous-location approvals (e.g., Class I, Div 1/2) require device-level certification by an NRTL to the applicable UL/ANSI standards.
* **Document your ESD control plan.** Align with your electronics team’s EMC/ESD budget and your facility’s handling procedures.

---

## Example BOM Stack

* **Outer housings & covers:** MJF **PA11**, bead-blasted exterior; selective **vapor smoothing** on internal surfaces.
* **ESD-critical panels or access doors:** PA11-ESD (LS) or platform-specific ESD mode parts, validated to your resistivity window.
* **Treads:** **TPU lugs** on a **PA11 carrier**, bolted or bonded.
* **Grounding hardware:** Brass heat-sets, stainless fasteners, spring contacts to chassis ground.

## FAQ

**Q1: What surface resistivity should I specify?**
Aim for **10^5–10^9 Ω/sq** for enclosures near sensitive electronics; define the test method and environment in your drawing notes.

**Q2: Will PA11 handle hydrocarbon splash?**
Yes, PA11 generally shows good resistance to fuels and oils. Always confirm against your exact fluid mix and temperature.

**Q3: Can I keep one printer platform?**
Often yes—use standard PA11 for most parts and route ESD-critical components to an ESD-capable material/process. Validate on first articles.

**Q4: Does vapor smoothing help?**
It improves cleanability and sealing surfaces. Just re-verify ESD and dimensions after finishing.

**Q5: What about traction on oily steel?**
Use **TPU lugs** for grip with a **PA11 carrier** for strength; keep lug modules replaceable to speed turnarounds.
