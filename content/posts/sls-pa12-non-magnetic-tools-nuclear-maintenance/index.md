# Nuclear-Plant Safe Tools: Non-Magnetic Nylon for Inspection and Repair

Nuclear maintenance teams need tools and fixturing that are **non-magnetic, contamination-smart, electrically insulating, and quick to deploy**—especially during tight outage windows. This guide explains how **SLS PA12 (nylon 12) tools and accessories** can de-risk work near sensitive instrumentation and contaminated systems, while keeping procurement agile and budgets sane.

Whether you’re planning a refuel outage or a rapid recovery job, our U.S.-based nylon 3D printing service manufactures **non-magnetic, non-sparking* polymer tools*\* purpose-built for nuclear facilities—delivered with practical torque limits, decon-friendly surfaces, and traceability options. (\*See safety notes on “non-sparking” in the FAQ.)

## Why non-magnetic nylon in a nuclear plant?

Most polymers—including PA12—are **diamagnetic**, meaning they show essentially no magnetic response (relative permeability \~1). That makes them ideal near **flux probes, magnetically sensitive instruments, and compasses/locators** where ferrous tools can cause interference or latch onto stainless hardware in tight spaces. Peer-reviewed overviews confirm that **polymers are broadly diamagnetic**, supporting nuclear use cases that demand a truly “quiet” magnetic profile. ([MDPI][1], [PMC][2])

SLS PA12 also brings a **balanced mechanical/electrical profile**: strong enough for practical hand-tool loads, inherently **electrically insulating** (volume resistivity \~10¹⁴–10¹⁵ Ω·cm; dielectric strength typically \~20–50 kV/mm), and chemically robust against many plant cleaners and oils. These properties are documented across industrial datasheets and testing references. ([smithmetal.com][3], [Wefapress®][4], [Makerly][5])

> Bottom line: Non-magnetic SLS PA12 tools minimize snagging and interference, add electrical insulation, and integrate easily into contamination control practices.

## Where nylon tools make the most sense

**Inspection & metrology**

* Borescope guides, probe shoes, and camera standoffs that won’t attract to ferrous internals.
* Soft-jaw adapters and **foreign material exclusion (FME) tethers** printed into the part to keep hold points organized. ([www-pub.iaea.org][6], [NRC Web][7])

**Light-to-moderate torque tasks**

* **Torque-limited polymer wrenches**, collet knobs, valve flag handles, and “last-inch” snugging tools on non-safety-related fasteners.

**Contamination management**

* **Scrapers, shims, wedges, caps, and drain-line plugs** with smooth, decon-friendly surfaces and high-visibility colors for easy frisking and retrieval. Current decontamination handbooks emphasize cleanable geometries and compatible materials. ([www-pub.iaea.org][8])

**Temporary fixture & handling aids**

* Lift-assist grips, alignment combs, cable keepers, instrument bump-guards—everything you’d machine from acetal or UHMW, but **designed overnight and printed same week**.

## Radiation-adjacent considerations (what PA12 handles—and what it doesn’t)

**Dose tolerance.** Multiple studies show **PA12 can tolerate significant gamma exposure** with property changes becoming measurable at industrial sterilization-scale doses. In SLS PA12, **20 Mrad (\~200 kGy) gamma** exposure reduced early-stage thermal stability by \~14 °C and trended mechanical weakening; at lower doses, impacts are smaller and sometimes offset by crosslinking. For maintenance tools used **near** (not in) high-flux fields, PA12 is often acceptable with prudent inspection intervals. ([usna.edu][9])

**Activation & magnetism.** Organic polymers have negligible activation risk compared with ferrous alloys and **remain non-magnetic**. That’s attractive around detectors and sensitive instruments. ([MDPI][1])

**Chemical decon compatibility.** IAEA methodology emphasizes choosing surfaces and materials that **decon cleanly**; PA12 tolerates many solutions but **bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can affect the surface**—use limited exposure and rinse thoroughly. We recommend peroxide or approved commercial agents when possible, and always follow site RP chemistry guidance. ([www-pub.iaea.org][8], [Makerly][5])

**ALARA alignment.** NRC and DOE materials encourage upfront planning that reduces time in the field, simplifies contamination control, and uses engineered aids to lower dose. Nylon tools designed specifically for the job support **ALARA by cutting handling time and rework**. ([NRC Web][10], [The Department of Energy's Energy.gov][11])

## Strength, torque, and how we keep you out of trouble

**Know the material envelope.** Typical SLS PA12 values: tensile strength \~45–50 MPa and modulus \~1.6–1.8 GPa, with good elongation and impact for a polymer. These are well-characterized industrial data points (EOS PA 2200 family). ([EOS GmbH][12], [EPFL][13])

**Practical torque for polymer fasteners.** As a **conservative reference point**, industry guidance for plastic screws (PA 6.6) lists tightening torques such as **M6 ≈ 0.8 N·m, M8 ≈ 1.8 N·m, M10 ≈ 3.5 N·m**. PA12 behaves similarly in many cases, but geometry, moisture, thread form, and inserts matter—**always verify on your hardware**.&#x20;

| Thread size | Typical polymer screw torque\* |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| M3          | \~0.10 N·m                     |
| M4          | \~0.25 N·m                     |
| M5          | \~0.50 N·m                     |
| M6          | \~0.80 N·m                     |
| M8          | \~1.80 N·m                     |
| M10         | \~3.50 N·m                     |

\*From Bossard guidance for PA6.6 plastic screws; use as **baseline only** and validate for PA12 and your joint design.&#x20;

**How we make torque safer:**

* **Integral torque-limiters (shear necks/clutches)** designed to your target setting (e.g., 0.8–3 N·m).
* **Non-magnetic bushings/inserts** (e.g., brass) where thread life is critical—still low-magnetic and activation-benign for most plant uses.
* **Large radii, ribbing, and boss design** to avoid stress risers.
* **Moisture-aware fits:** PA12’s lower water uptake vs. PA6 reduces swelling risk, but we still factor humidity into tolerances. ([AZoM][14])

---

## Contamination-safe design features (built in from CAD)

* **Smooth, wipeable surfaces** (Ra targets and bead-blasted finishing) to limit trap sites; avoid blind cracks. IAEA decon guidance favors surfaces that rinse clean and minimize residue. ([www-pub.iaea.org][8])
* **Color coding & serialization** in the print (laser-etched or embossed) to speed frisking and accountability.
* **FME-ready ergonomics:** lanyard eyes, captive features, and pocket-free profiles aligned with FME program playbooks. ([www-pub.iaea.org][6])
* **Rad-chem compatibility choices:** request peroxide-first cleaning compatibility; we’ll avoid pigments and additives that resist decon.

## Quality, traceability, and how we fit your program

If the work touches safety-related boundaries or requires dedication, your QA and procurement will ask the right questions. We’re ready.

* **Documentation:** Lot-level COCs, resin lot traceability, traveler records, and inspection reports.
* **Identification & control of items:** Serialization and labeling per your receiving/issuance process.
* **Commercial-grade dedication (when required):** We support your CGD plan and acceptance criteria. The regulatory backbone here is **10 CFR 50 Appendix B** and NRC **Regulatory Guide 1.28 (Rev. 6)**. ([NRC Web][15])

> We are not a safety-related components vendor by default; when a project requires dedication, we follow **your** CGD or partner with your qualified dedicating entity per NRC FAQ guidance. ([NRC Web][16])

## What we 3D print for nuclear maintenance (examples)

* **Non-magnetic hand tools:** torque-limited wrenches, valve flag handles, knurled knobs, spanner sockets.
* **Inspection fixtures:** probe shoes, camera guides, gauge holders, spacer blocks with non-marring contact faces.
* **Decon & shielding aids:** scraper heads, wedge sets, temporary covers, bright-color caps and plugs.
* **FME hardware:** tetherable pouches, tag sets, tool racks, and captive-fastener organizers.

All parts are produced in **SLS PA12** (EOS-class powders) with balanced mechanical properties and robust chemical resistance. ([EOS GmbH][12])

---

## SLS PA12 design guidelines we apply (so your parts last)

* **Section thickness:** 2.5–4.0 mm typical for tools; go thicker where torque is applied.
* **Ribs & fillets:** rib height \~2–3× wall; fillet radii ≥ 1× wall; add **shear-neck features** for torque limiters.
* **Metal-free unless needed:** prefer **all-polymer** where magnetism matters; use **brass inserts** when thread life dominates.
* **Surface options:** as-sintered matte; bead blast; sealed finish where frequent decon is expected.
* **Electrical insulation:** PA12 provides high dielectric strength—use it to advantage for **insulated handles and guards** (verify creepage/clearance for your voltage class). ([smithmetal.com][3])

## How nylon tools support ALARA & outage efficiency

Regulatory and training guidance emphasize **planning, engineered controls, and contamination discipline**. Purpose-built polymer tools **reduce time-in-field**, minimize rework from tool-to-metal damage, and simplify surveys/decon—helping you meet ALARA goals during emergent work. ([NRC Web][10], [The Department of Energy's Energy.gov][11])

---

## Ordering & typical lead times

1. **Email us drawings or just a photo + dimensions** (we’ll CAD it): **[info@nylon3dprint.com](mailto:info@nylon3dprint.com)**
2. We confirm **load/torque targets**, decon chemistry, marking, and FME features.
3. **Print, finish, and inspect**—then ship with COC and serialized labeling.

Standard small tools ship fast; complex fixtures with inserts or special finishing add a few days. (For safety-related work, lead time depends on your QA flowdown and CGD plan.)

## Frequently asked questions

**Are these tools “non-sparking”?**

Plastics don’t create hot impact sparks the way ferrous metals can, and nylon striking faces are widely used to **reduce** spark risk. However, formal “non-sparking tool” definitions typically refer to **non-ferrous metal alloys** (Cu-Be, Al-bronze). Treat nylon tools as **spark-reduction**, and follow your site’s combustible controls. ([ccohs.ca][17])

**What dose can the tools take?**

There’s no single number—environment and chemistry matter. Lab work on **SLS PA12** shows measurable changes at high sterilization-scale doses (e.g., **\~200 kGy/20 Mrad**). For **adjacent** work (RP-controlled areas, not core internals), PA12 is commonly acceptable with inspection and replacement criteria. We’ll help you set those. ([usna.edu][9])

**Will they hold torque?**

Within reason. We design around **0.1–4 N·m** as the “sweet spot” for many hand ops, add **torque-limiters**, and validate on your joint. Use the table above only as a **starting point** and verify on your hardware.&#x20;

**What about cleaning and decon?**

Smooth surfaces, rounded transitions, and limited hollow cavities make parts easy to wipe, rinse, and survey. Prefer peroxide or site-approved agents; keep **bleach** exposure short and always rinse. ([www-pub.iaea.org][8], [Makerly][5])

**Can you meet our QA expectations?**

Yes for commercial and many augmented-quality jobs; for safety-related scope we align to **10 CFR 50 App. B / RG 1.28** via your CGD plan. ([NRC Web][15])
