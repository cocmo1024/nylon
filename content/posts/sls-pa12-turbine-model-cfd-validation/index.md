# Hydro Turbine CFD Validation: High-Accuracy Nylon Scale Models

**Build confidence in your CFD with metrology-verified, SLS PA12 scale models engineered for water tunnels, air tunnels, and benchtop rigs.** This guide outlines how we design, print, finish, and instrument nylon models that behave predictably under IEC/ASME test practices—so you can move from simulation to trusted data faster.

## TL;DR

* **Why SLS PA12?** Tough, stable, and chemically resistant; enables internal flow paths and integrated manifolds that cast or machined models struggle to achieve. Typical **standard accuracy is ±0.3% (≥±0.3 mm)**, with 0.12 mm layers—excellent for scale hardware and pressure-tap patterns. ([materialise.com][1])
* **Surface finish you can tune for fidelity:** As-printed SLS is grainy; **vapor smoothing can reduce Ra by \~70–80%**, closing porosity and bringing surfaces closer to molded finishes. ([Formlabs][2], [amtechnologies.com][3])
* **Hydro model testing:** We align geometry, surface condition, and instrumentation with **IEC 60193 model acceptance tests** and ASME supplements for pressure measurement and uncertainty. ([ITeh Standards][4], [webstore.ansi.org][5])
* **Instrumentation-ready:** Clean, sealed pressure taps, threaded inserts in PA12, and internal manifolds improve data quality and turnaround. ([protolabs.com][6])

## Why SLS PA12 (Nylon 12) for validation models

**Mechanical stability & printability.** EOS PA 2200 (PA12) offers a balanced property set—tensile strength \~48 MPa, modulus \~1.6 GPa—and is proven across industrial SLS platforms (P 396/P 500/P 770). That stability matters when you need thin trailing edges, integrated bosses, and assemblies that hold shape through handling and wet testing. ([EOS GmbH][7])

**Accuracy that fits CFD-to-test workflows.** Industrial SLS services publish **standard accuracy around ±0.3% (≥±0.3 mm)** with **\~0.12 mm layer thickness**, sufficient for tap spacing, aero/hydrodynamic contours, and reversible shims. ([materialise.com][1])

**Complex internals, no support scars.** Powder-bed sintering supports **internal channels and manifolds** without support stubs—ideal for pressure distribution galleries, purge lines, and PIV windows with protective bosses. ([materialise.com][1])

**Surface options for physics control.** As-printed PA12 has a matte, grainy texture; **vapor smoothing** or **media finishing** can tune roughness to your test plan—either minimize it to approach hydraulically smooth conditions or **apply controlled roughness** segments to study boundary-layer effects. ([Formlabs][2], [Sandia National Laboratories][8])

## Target specs for hydro & tunnel models (recommended)

| Attribute              |                                             Recommended starting point | Why it matters                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dimensional accuracy   | **±0.3% (≥±0.3 mm)**; critical fits may be reamed/machined after print | Baseline accuracy for SLS PA12; post-machining gives metrology-grade interfaces. ([materialise.com][1])                                      |
| Layer thickness        |                                                            **0.12 mm** | Smooth enough for gentle curvature, keeps build time reasonable. ([materialise.com][1])                                                      |
| Minimum wall           |       **≥1.0 mm** (rigid); **≥1.5 mm** if tapped or frequently handled | Prevents print fragility and thread breakout on thin edges. ([materialise.com][1])                                                           |

## Dimensional control and metrology: how we hit “model-grade” tolerances

1. **Design for post-machining at datum interfaces.** We print locating pads, pilot bores, and shim lands oversize by 0.2–0.4 mm, then **ream or face to final size** on pinned fixtures. This locks in bearing fits, dowel alignment, and coaxiality beyond standard SLS tolerances. ([materialise.com][1])
2. **Compensation & orientation.** We orient parts to minimize Z-axis stair-stepping on sensitive contours and apply empirically derived compensation for shrink/warp on large, thin diaphragms. (SLS shrink \~3–3.5% is handled in slicer/process control.) ([Xometry Pro][11])
3. **Material choice & inserts.** For threads that will see repeated assembly, we **install brass heat-set or press-in inserts** into PA12; this preserves torque capacity and keeps threads stable after multiple wet/dry cycles. ([protolabs.com][6])
4. **Measurement package.** At delivery, we can include a **CMM/scan report** on critical sections—leading/trailing edge offsets, pressure tap map, datum spacing—and an **uncertainty summary** aligned to **ASME PTC 19.2** guidance for pressure measurements used in acceptance testing. ([webstore.ansi.org][5])

---

## Surface finish for fidelity (and when to *add* roughness on purpose)

**What “as-printed” looks like.** SLS PA12’s natural texture is matte and slightly porous. For **smooth-wall** CFD correlation runs, **vapor smoothing** reduces average surface roughness **\~70–80%** and seals pores, helping laminar/turbulent development track predictions and improving water resistance. ([Formlabs][2])

**When roughness is the test variable.** Many validation programs need **controlled roughness** to match field-worn prototypes or to trip boundary layers at scale. You can specify **equivalent sand-grain roughness (kₛ)** zones, and we’ll implement those via media selection, masked blasting, applique films, or printed roughness elements. Literature shows how roughness placement/height ties to Reynolds-number matching and performance deltas; Sandia’s wind-turbine validation work is a useful template for selecting a target **kₛ** and spanwise extent. ([Sandia National Laboratories][8], [usna.edu][12])

**Documenting the surface condition.** We can log **Ra/Rz** samples and photograph features so your test report clearly states the model’s roughness state—useful when you’re working under **IEC 60193** model acceptance procedures. ([ITeh Standards][4])

---

## Instrumentation ports and internal channels (pressure-tight, repeatable, serviceable)

**Pressure taps and manifolds.** We print **straight pilot bores** to each tap, then drill/ream to the specified diameter and depth for **flush static taps**. Internal **manifold galleries** can join multiple taps to a common bulkhead fitting, reducing external tubing clutter. For accuracy and dynamic response, we follow **ASME PTC 19.2** installation considerations and typical industry spacing rules (e.g., avoiding disturbed flow near fittings), and we can adapt to your lab’s tubing/ferrule standards. ([webstore.ansi.org][5], [EPRI Rest Service][13])

**Threaded inserts.** PA12 accepts **heat-set or press-in brass inserts** for repeated connect/disconnect of pressure fittings and probe mounts. We’ll size bosses and edge distances to avoid breakout and to keep seals concentric. ([protolabs.com][6])

**Watertightness.** For **long-duration water exposure**, especially in recirculating tunnels, we recommend **impregnation** or **vapor smoothing** plus gasketed joints. Community and vendor data indicate SLS can be water-resistant as built, but sealing greatly improves performance for extended submersion. ([materialise.com][9], [Sculpteo][14], [Xometry's Manufacturing Community][10])

**Alternative taps and belts.** If your plan calls for **pressure belts** or **tightly spaced taps** around leading edges, we can integrate bosses and raceways for micro-tubing, drawing on wind-tunnel precedents where **0.5 mm–0.8 mm** orifices and dense spacing have been used successfully. ([OSTI][15], [Wiley Online Library][16])

## Aligning with standards and V\&V best practices

* **IEC 60193:2019** defines **model acceptance tests** for hydraulic turbines, including how to interpret results and document conditions—your model geometry, instrumentation, and **documented surface state** should reflect the test objective. We build to that end. ([ITeh Standards][4])
* **ASME PTC 19.2** (Pressure Measurement) and **PTC 19.1** (Test Uncertainty, cited within NASA CFD validation procedures) guide instrument selection, installation, and uncertainty budgets. We design ports and galleries to support clean calibrations and traceable pressure paths. ([webstore.ansi.org][5], [turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov][17])
* **Roughness modeling in CFD.** If you’re using a **kₛ-based wall model**, we can produce witness coupons and measured Ra/Rz to help you back-out an appropriate **kₛ** for your solver settings, consistent with recent reviews of rough-wall drag prediction. ([usna.edu][12])

---

## Typical ordering workflow (what we need to start)

1. **Geometry package:** STEP/Parasolid for solids, **plus** a lightweight STL for intent review. Identify **test article**, **fixtures**, and **consumables** (e.g., alternative roughness strips).
2. **Test plan highlights:** Target **Re/Fr**, **surface condition** (smooth/roughness zones), **pressure-tap map** (diameter, depth, ID), **sensor types**, and any **standard** you’re working under (IEC 60193, lab SOPs). ([ITeh Standards][4])
3. **Tolerance map:** Flag **metrology-critical** edges and bores—those will get post-machining callouts and CMM checkpoints. Baseline SLS accuracy is **±0.3% (≥±0.3 mm)**; we’ll propose ream/face ops for anything tighter. ([materialise.com][1])
4. **Surface plan:** Choose **as-printed**, **media-finished**, **vapor-smoothed**, or **custom roughness** zones. Provide kₛ or Ra targets if you’re matching a CFD wall model. ([Formlabs][2], [usna.edu][12])
5. **Water-exposure profile:** If submerged for hours/days, select **impregnation** or **vapor smoothing** and specify any **chemical compatibility** concerns. ([materialise.com][9])

## FAQs

**Why PA12 SLS over SLA or machined plastics?**

SLA can deliver very smooth surfaces, but PA12 SLS combines **toughness**, **chemical resistance**, and **support-free internal channels** for pressure galleries and instrumentation. You can still achieve smooth walls via **vapor smoothing**—and you avoid brittle behavior during handling and assembly. ([EOS GmbH][7], [Formlabs][2])

**Can SLS PA12 be watertight for water-tunnel testing?**

Yes—with the right design and finish. SLS parts are generally **water-resistant**; **impregnation** and **vapor smoothing** significantly reduce surface permeability for long exposures or higher static heads. ([materialise.com][9], [Xometry's Manufacturing Community][10])

**How small can pressure taps be?**

We print pilots and **drill/ream** to your spec. Many wind-tunnel and hydro studies use **sub-millimeter taps**; we’ll advise on boss geometry, edge distance, and tubing to maintain signal quality and avoid leaks. ([OSTI][15])

**What about model acceptance testing?**

If your program follows **IEC 60193**, we’ll document **geometry, surface condition, and instrumentation** and can provide **CMM/scan** plus photos for the test report. ([ITeh Standards][4])

**Do you support quick-change roughness?**

Yes—maskable zones, applique films, or clip-on roughness panels let you execute **A/B runs** without a new model. For selecting target **kₛ** and chordwise extent, we can mirror approaches used in Sandia/NASA validation casework. ([Sandia National Laboratories][8])
