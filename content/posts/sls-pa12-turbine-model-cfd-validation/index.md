# Hydro Turbine CFD Validation: High-Accuracy Nylon Scale Models

When you’re validating CFD on a hydro runner or a marine turbine, **scale models that actually match the mesh**—not just “look” the part—make or break the campaign. This page details how we produce **metrology-grade SLS PA12 (nylon 12) models** for water-tunnel and tow-tank work, plus what to expect on tolerance, surface finish, and instrumentation.

We build for **U.S. hydro OEMs, university labs, and national facilities** that need test articles within days, not months, while staying aligned with **IEC 60193 model-test practice** and **ASME PTC 18 performance testing** on the prototype side. ([iTeh Standards][1], [asme.org][2])

## Why SLS PA12 for model validation

* **Dimensional stability & robustness.** PA12 is the most proven SLS polymer; it offers a balanced property profile with good chemical resistance and low moisture uptake compared with other nylons—useful when parts see prolonged water exposure. ([EOS GmbH][3], [formlabs-media.formlabs.com][4])
* **Complex internals, no support scars.** SLS builds within a powder bed, enabling **closed internal channels**, serpentine passages, and cable conduits with no support removal risk. Typical **standard accuracy** for SLS PA12 is **±0.3% with a lower limit around ±0.3 mm** (and we routinely beat that on critical features through compensation). ([Protolabs Network][5], [materialise.com][6])
* **Finish options matched to fluid studies.** Media-tumbled and bead-blasted “as-sintered” surfaces are fine for many studies; **vapor smoothing** can seal porosity and drop Ra dramatically (often **\~70–80% reduction**), which helps with watertightness and boundary-layer control. ([Formlabs][7], [dyemansion.com][8])

---

## What we deliver (typical)

* **Runner, stator, guide-vanes, and scale fixtures**, consolidated where possible to remove leakage paths.
* **Metrology pack**: CMM or blue-light scan overlay to CAD, full feature report on datum frames, and weld-line/split-line verification.
* **Instrumentation-ready geometry**: pressure-tap flats, O-ring grooves, PIV windows, strain-gauge cable routes, and **printed internal conduits** for break-out at the sting.
* **Finish choice by test objective**: roughness-controlled surfaces (Ra targets), sealed surfaces for immersion, or masked zones for optical access.

## Standards we align with (and why they matter)

**IEC 60193** governs **model acceptance tests** for hydraulic turbines and pump-turbines. While it doesn’t dictate material choice, it **does set expectations for similitude (Froude/Reynolds), measurement stability, and correction for roughness and scale effects**—all of which tie directly to how we specify surface finish and dimensional control. For field testing on the full machine, **ASME PTC 18** defines how prototype head, flow, and efficiency are measured—your model program should be set up to correlate to that language. ([iTeh Standards][1], [normservis.cz][9], [asme.org][2])

For **free-surface flows and cavitation studies**, we reference **Froude similarity** (for gravity-dominated regimes) and consider **Reynolds thresholds** where IEC and the literature warn about Re-dependence—informing our roughness strategy when full Re matching isn’t feasible. ([usbr.gov][10], [ResearchGate][11])

## Tolerance strategy for CFD-faithful geometry

**Baseline SLS capability**

* **Global:** ±0.3% with floor ±0.30 mm (typical); many service bureaus cite the same class of performance for PA12. ([materialise.com][6], [Protolabs Network][5])
* **Select features (controlled with compensation & fixturing):** ±0.15–0.25 mm over 100 mm spans on EOS-class systems is achievable on prismatic geometries, verified by CMM. (This is consistent with industry guidance and our in-house results; always geometry-dependent.) ([protolabs.com][12], [ZELTA3D USA][13])

**How we hold it**

1. **Upstream CAD compensation** using machine-specific scale and warp maps.
2. **Datum scheme** per **ASME Y14.5** so metrology and mounting align; we reference the GD\&T framework (datums, profile, runout) in the inspection report. ([asme.org][14])
3. **Thermal & moisture conditioning** before scan—PA12 has **lower water absorption** than PA6/PA66, but we still equilibrate parts to minimize drift. ([intechpower.com][15])

## Surface finish and roughness control

* **As-sintered:** Fine “powdery” matte; typical SLS roughness sits in the low tens of microns Ra.
* **Media tumble + bead blast:** Evens texture, good for general hydrodynamics where small roughness is acceptable.
* **Vapor smoothing (AMT/DyeMansion class):**

  * Seals porosity, improves washdown/watertightness.
  * **Reduces Ra by \~70–80%** in published studies, making roughness-induced drag less of a variable. ([Formlabs][7], [dyemansion.com][8])

We specify roughness using **ISO profile parameters (Ra/Rz)** and record lengths understood by your lab; surface-metrology guides summarize the current ISO 21920/legacy ISO 4287 parameter set. ([guide.digitalsurf.com][16])

> **Tip:** When Reynolds similarity isn’t reachable at scale, **IEC 60193** allows for **roughness corrections** when transposing results to the prototype—so documenting surface parameters is not bureaucracy; it’s your uncertainty budget. ([jafmonline.net][17])

## Instrumentation porting that doesn’t leak (or drift)

**Pressure taps & static ports**

* Printed pilot holes with **machined break-through** to eliminate powder residue at the lip; flat land for ferrules; optional **bronze bushings** for repeated connect/disconnect.
* **Internal cable & tubing channels** are printed in, with minimum channel Ø ≥ 1.0 mm and sweep radii to match your tubing bend limits. (SLS supports true internal passages; we vac/ultrasonic-clean, then prove-out flow.) ([Protolabs Network][5])

**Seals & windows**

* O-ring grooves per **ASME/AS568** callouts; groove geometry qualified on witness coupons.
* Acrylic/Plexiglas view windows are pocketed with a shoulder and captured with a nylon clamp ring; faces can be **vapor-smoothed** for better sealing. ([dyemansion.com][8])

**Cable-ready stings & mounts**

* We provide **sting interface blocks** with datum bores and dowels so the model picks up on your lab rig with minimal shimming.

## Water-tunnel & tow-tank usage notes (from the bench)

* **Conditioning:** Let parts equilibrate at lab humidity/temperature pre-test; PA12 absorbs **far less water** than PA6, but equilibrating keeps geometry stable for CMM and your tare. ([intechpower.com][15])
* **Leak-down test:** After plumbing pressure taps, we run a low-pressure hold to confirm seals before committing tunnel time.
* **Optical prep:** Mask or polish zones used for PIV/LDV; vapor smoothing can help, but we’ll coordinate to the optical path you use. ([dyemansion.com][8])
* **Scale effects:** For cavitation or free-surface work, lock Froude first; we’ll document roughness so you can apply **IEC 60193** scaling corrections in post-processing. ([iTeh Standards][1])

## Case snapshot: Axial-flow runner, Midwest lab

A university partner needed a **0.3-scale axial runner** and stator for thrust/torque characterization and wake mapping. We consolidated the hub cable routing and printed **internal 1.5 mm ID conduits** to exit at the sting. After **vapor smoothing** and gasket-land finishing, the assembly passed a 30-minute leak-hold. CMM overlay on four blades showed **±0.18 mm profile error (100 mm chord)** and **±0.12 mm on datum bores**, which matched the CFD blade sections within the lab’s tolerance window. (Results depend on geometry; these numbers illustrate the approach, not a guarantee.)

## Material data you can design to

* **PA12 (EOS PA2200-class) properties** commonly referenced by labs and service bureaus:

  * Tensile strength \~45–50 MPa; Vicat softening \~160–180 °C; **water absorption at 23 °C/50% RH \~0.5%** (saturation in hot water \~1.9%).
  * Use these as **order-of-magnitude** design inputs and rely on our **lot-specific COA** for print runs. ([EPFL][18], [3D Formtech][19])
